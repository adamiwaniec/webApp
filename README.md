Library management app made in Laravel with JS, CSS, and React. Some assumptions made: registration functionality wasn't made in order to focus on the rest of the app, like front-end. However, it can be implemented with the code structure. There are prewritten accounts with their own amount of money to spend. They can't spend more money than they have.

Prewritten user login details: userX, passwordX. X is any of the integers 1-5.

Run with "npm install" and "npm run dev" in cli.
