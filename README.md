Library management system made in Laravel with JS, CSS, and React. Some assumptions made: registration functionality wasn't made in order to focus on the rest of the app like front-end. However, it can be implemented with the code structure. 

Prewritten user login details: userX, passwordX. X is any of the integers 1-5.
